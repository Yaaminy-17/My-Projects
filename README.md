# My-Projects
Yaaminy - Aspiring Innovator in Electronics and Communication Engineering  , a dedicated student in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My journey in ECE is driven by an insatiable curiosity for the intricate world of electronics and the endless possibilities it offers.

The attached projects are :

1. Wifi jammer using ARDUINO UNO  - A WiFi jammer is a device that disrupts the connection of WiFi-enabled devices by transmitting interference signals. Using an Arduino Uno, you can create a basic WiFi jammer that sends signals to overwhelm and block WiFi communication.
   
2. Collision detection warning system using ADUINO UNO-A collision detection warning system helps prevent accidents by alerting users to obstacles in their path. Using an Arduino Uno, you can create a basic system that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect objects and provide warnings.

3. Android malware detetction using machine learning - An Android malware detection system uses machine learning to identify malicious applications on Android devices. This system can analyze various features of apps to distinguish between benign and malicious behavior.
